Developed a weather app using Android and Kotlin, utilizing OpenWeatherMap’s API and JSON Syntax to gather data.
The app dynamically presents a comprehensive weather experience, showcasing over five essential details, ranging from Temperature to sunrise/sunset times.
Integrated dynamic icons that change based on the weather and time, providing users with an intuitive visual representation of the current conditions.
Added features such as a refresh button for updating the user’s location and a dark mode to reduce eye strain.
Utilized Retrofit as an HTTP client for efficient data retrieval and communication with the API.
